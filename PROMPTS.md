I want to build a Cloudflare Workers AI app that has chat, uses Durable Objects for session memory, KV for storage, and a simple web UI. Provide the initial project structure.

Export the project as a downloadable folder and give setup instructions so I can run it locally.

The app is showing configuration errors. Help me fix wrangler.toml.

I'm getting an error that the Durable Object is not exported. How do I correctly export SessionDO?

I'm seeing type errors for AI, KVNamespace, and DurableObject types. How do I correctly set up the Workers TypeScript environment?

The AI binding throws an error saying it needs to run remotely. How do I switch to remote dev?

It says I need to register a workers.dev subdomain. How do I set that up?

I deployed, but now I'm seeing "Assets have not yet been deployed" when running remote dev. How do I fix this?

I'm on the free plan and I'm seeing a Durable Object storage / migration error. How do I change my migration to use SQLite Durable Objects?

Everything is working now. Can you redesign the UI in a neobrutalist style?

In wrangler.toml, what parts are safe to commit and what should remain private?
